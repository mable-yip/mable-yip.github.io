We study 93 don\u2019t-do-that guidelines in the Material Design, a complex design system created by Google. We find that these don\u2019t-guidelines go far beyond UI aesthetics, and involve seven general design dimensions (layout, typography, iconography, navigation, communication, color, and shape) and four component design aspects (anatomy, placement, behavior, and usage). Violating these guidelines results in visual design smells in UIs (or UI design smells). In a study of 60,756 UIs of 9,286 Android apps, we find that 7,497 UIs of 2,587 apps have at least one violation of some Material Design guidelines.
